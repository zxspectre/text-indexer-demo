The word utopia was coined in 1516 from Ancient Greek by the Englishman Sir Thomas More for his Latin text Utopia.
It literally translates as “no place”, coming from the Greek: οὐ (“not”) and τόπος (“place”), and meant any non-existent society,
when ‘described in considerable detail’.[4] However, in standard usage, the word's meaning has shifted and now usually describes
 a non-existent society that is intended to be viewed as considerably better than contemporary society.[5]

In his original work, More carefully pointed out the similarity of the word to eutopia, meaning “good place”, from Greek:
εὖ (“good” or “well”) and τόπος (“place”), which ostensibly would be the more appropriate term for the concept in modern English.
The pronunciations of eutopia and utopia in English are identical, which may have given rise to the change in meaning.[5][6]
Dystopia, a term meaning "bad place" coined in 1868, draws on this latter meaning. The opposite of a utopia,
dystopia is a concept which surpassed utopia in popularity in the fictional literature from the 1950s onwards,
chiefly because of the impact of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.

In 1876, writer Charles Renouvier published a novel called Uchronia (French Uchronie).[7] The neologism, using chronos instead of topos,
has since been used to refer to non-existent idealized times in fiction, such as Philip Roth's The Plot Against America (2004),[8]
and Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle (1962).[9]

According to the Philosophical Dictionary, proto-utopian ideas begin as early as the period of ancient Greece and Rome,
medieval heretics, peasant revolts and establish themselves in the period of the early capitalism, reformation
and Renaissance (Hus, Müntzer, More, Campanella), democratic revolutions (Meslier, Morelly, Mably, Winstanley,
later Babeufists, Blanquists,) and in a period of turbulent development of capitalism that highlighted antagonisms
of capitalist society (Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, Cabet, Lamennais, Proudhon and their followers).[10]
